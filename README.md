# Federated Multi-Agent Drone Swarm Prototype

This project simulates a swarm of drones that each learn locally from camera input and then share updates to build a common global policy through federated learning.

**Technologies used:**  
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- HuggingFace Transformers

**Files included:**
- `federated_drone_swarm.py` – main prototype script
- `requirements.txt` – list of dependencies to install

This is a prototype to show the basic idea; real deployment would require real drones, real images, and proper RL algorithms.
